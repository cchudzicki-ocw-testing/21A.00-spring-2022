#### Ritual Design

For the first research project this semester, we conducted ethnographic research on “naturally occurring” ritual practices, applying social theory to the interpretation of empirical, qualitative data. For this second project, we will apply what we learned to designing our own new rituals.

Although anthropology is often thought of as a descriptive or interpretative social science, it has many practical applications. These include: **applied anthropology**, a “complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct   
action, and/or the formulation of policy” (Van Willigen 2002: 10); and **design anthropology**, “in which anthropological methods and concepts are mobilized in the design process” (Murphy 2016: 434). In this project, we will be drawing on these approaches to prototype useful new cultural forms.

**Design Brief**

Create shared rituals to enhance this class. An academic class is a ritual form with conventionalized form and function. Analyze the existing classroom protocols as a culturally conventionalized ritual form, and hack that form to change the function or improve the outcome. Initial parameters and constraints include:

- The essential purpose of teaching anthropology must be upheld, but designers may specify content or create roles for instructional staff beyond the previously specified scope of the class.
- The design must be human-centered and socially responsible, respecting the needs and experiences of all members of the classroom community.
- If materials are needed, please check with the instructors. Once purchases are approved, we can make them ourselves or arrange reimbursement.

**Schedule**

Workshop I (Session 15): Open-ended ideation

- Working in 4-5 randomly assigned groups, develop lo-fi classroom ritual wireframe for presentation at end of class.
- Use RDT Section 1 (“Scope”) and Appendix A.
- Decide on appropriate components for future phases.

Workshop II (Session 19): Small group work on specific design components
