#### Course Description

Through the comparative study of different cultures, anthropology explores fundamental questions about what it means to be human. It seeks to understand how culture both shapes societies, from the smallest island in the South Pacific to the largest Asian metropolis, and affects the way institutions work, from scientific laboratories to Christian mega-churches. This course will provide a framework for analyzing diverse facets of human experience such as gender, ethnicity, language, politics, economics, and art.

#### Learning Objectives

- Develop a firm understanding of major contemporary debates in anthropology, and their broader social implications
- Gain experience with ethnographic research methods, and an appreciation of their historical development and epistemological underpinnings
- Become comfortable reading anthropological research and applying anthropological theories to analyzing cultural phenomena
- Pioneer new methods of *making* culture, experimentally applying anthropological ideas to effect positive change in the world
